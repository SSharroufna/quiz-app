## App Overview

My quiz app will challenge users with a series of multiple-choice questions on general Technology topic. Users will test their knowledge and receive instant feedback on their answers. The app will keep track of the score and provide a final result at the end of the quiz.

## API and Technology

I used vanilla JavaScript, which means no use of any external libraries or frameworks. To populate our app with trivia questions, I leveraged the Open Trivia DB API, which provides a vast collection of questions across different categories and difficulty levels.

## App Features

- Fetching and displaying trivia questions from the API.
- Implementing a countdown timer for each question.
- Allowing users to select their answer from multiple choices.
- Providing instant feedback on correct and incorrect answers.
- Calculating and displaying the final score at the end of the quiz.
